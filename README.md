# Computer Science Notes 
of BATCH 2024 STEM 12-14.

We did this repository for fun and ofcourse an online backup is always helpful. We mainly used Obsidian for writing our notes which is why its using the markdown format.
To the people who see this repo, hopefully this vault of notes would help you in either college or just in general learning about computer science itself.
