## Normal Notes
A well defined computational procedure that takes some values, as [[Input]] and produces some value, or a set of values as [[Output]] in a finite time.

A tool for solving a [[Computational problem]]. It describes a computational problem to connect the relationship of the [[Input]] and [[Output]].

Example: You need to sort a sequence of numbers into an increasing order. We define this sorting problem by:
	[[Input]]: A sequence of disorganized numbers (3, 4, 2, 1, 7, 5, 6)
	[[Output]]: A reordered sequence of numbers increasing (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
